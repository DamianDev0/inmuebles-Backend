Project Update: Response Interceptor and SOLID Principles
Description
In this update, several key enhancements were made to the property management module, specifically focusing on improving response handling with a newly implemented response interceptor and adhering to SOLID principles in the code structure.

Key Implementations
Response Interceptor

What was implemented: A response interceptor was added to the application to modify outgoing responses from the property routes, particularly focusing on standardizing response formats.
Purpose: To ensure all responses are consistent, clean, and formatted before they reach the client, enhancing the overall user experience.
How it works: The interceptor captures each outgoing response, allowing us to alter, log, or wrap data as needed. This reduces redundancy and ensures a centralized way to handle all responses.
Changes to the POST Method in PropertiesController

Enhancement: Updated the POST method to better align with SOLID principles, making the code more maintainable and easier to test.
Controller Responsibilities:
The controller now primarily handles routing and delegates the business logic to services, ensuring each part of the application has a clear and defined responsibility.
Adherence to SOLID Principles

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class and function has a single, well-defined responsibility. The controller handles the routing, while services manage business logic.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The interceptor and the updated methods are open for extension but closed for modification, meaning we can add more response handling features without altering existing functionality.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): All implementations respect the interfaces, ensuring modules can be replaced without breaking the application.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Interfaces are defined clearly and are specific to their respective services, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The controller depends on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, making it flexible and easier to test.
Routing Updates

The PropertiesController now handles property-related routes such as /properties, ensuring all property management actions are grouped logically within this controller.
Summary
The response interceptor provides a standardized way of formatting and managing responses across the application.
The PropertiesController has been restructured to align with SOLID principles, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code.
This update enhances the scalability of the codebase, making it easier to extend and maintain over time.
