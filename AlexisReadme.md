# Project Update: Property Deletion Service

## Description

This update adds a feature for deleting properties in the property management module, improving the system by implementing a reliable and efficient deletion process.

## Key Implementations

### Delete Property Service

- **Implementation:** Added `DeletePropertyService` to handle property deletions using the property ID.
- **Purpose:** To remove properties effectively with proper error handling for non-existent entries.

### Integration into `AppService`

- **Update:** Integrated `DeletePropertyService` into `AppService` for unified property management (creation and deletion).

### Module Update

- **Enhancement:** Updated the application module to register `DeletePropertyService`, ensuring it is available for use.

## SOLID Principles

- **SRP:** Clear separation of responsibilities with dedicated services for creation and deletion.
- **OCP:** Services are extendable without modifying existing code.
- **LSP:** Adheres to defined interfaces for service replacement.
- **ISP:** Well-defined interfaces specific to services.
- **DIP:** Depend on abstractions for easier testing and maintenance.

## Summary

- **New Feature:** Added a property deletion service with error handling.
- **Integration:** Combined creation and deletion services in `AppService`.
- **Module Update:** Registered the new service in the application module.

This update enhances property management by introducing a structured approach to deletion and integrating it into the existing service framework.
